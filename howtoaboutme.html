    <div><p> I created a website that shows some of the many different things about me. 
    This website is made up of amny codes that I have put together to create this website.</p>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Langage. It is the standard markuo language for creating web pages. It is the skeleton of your website.
    The HTML tags are element names that are surrouned by angle brackets.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Paragraphs, Headers, and Images</b></p>
    
    <p>To make my title, I used an &lt;h&gt; tag. To center it, I added a style attribute called text-align: center;. 
    To create the paragraphs, I used the &lt;p&gt; tag. To add an image, I used the src attribute with the &lt;img&gt; tag to put an image from the internet.</p>

    <img src="pictures/hobbyscreenshot.png" width="400px">
    <img src="pictures/travelscreenshot.png" width="400px">
    
    <p>I made the second title by using the &lt;h2&gt; tag. I added a style attribute to change the size and color of the font. To make a list, you use the &lt;ul&gt; tag. The &lt;ul&gt; tag creates bullet points. 
    Whenever you create a list, you always have to use the &lt;li&gt; tag. Without it, you can't make a list. </p>
    
    <h4>What is CSS?</h4>
    <p>CSS is the language that describes the style of an HTML document. In the CSS, you use it to add different styles to your text. 
    I took a selector from my HTML and then added declarations in ellipsis. I put a &lt;div&gt; tag around all my &lt;p&gt; tags and gave each of them a different id so that in the CSS, they don't get mixed up.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:20px"><b>What is a navbar?</b></p>
    
    <p>A navbar allows you to click on a certain part of the text that takes you to a different page or website. 
    To make a navbar, I had to create a css that would tell what the navbar to do. Once you create the css, you start adding different declarations to it. 
    You would add the declarations to the selectors to change what you want in the website. In the navbar selector I added a background color for the font by adding a declaration(background-color: purple;). 
    I also added text-align: center; to center the navbar.</p>
