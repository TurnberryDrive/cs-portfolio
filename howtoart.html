     <h1> What I Made </h1>
     <img style="float:right" src="pictures/hotairballoon.png" width="600px">
  <p>I created a website that has a hot air balloon with moving clouds in the background. <br>
      Whenever you click on the screen, a color-changing balloon appears where ever you <br>
      click. Depending on where the location of the mouse, the balloons will either be <br>
      turquoise or color changing. This project, overall, works very well. Everything <br>
      that I wanted the website to do that I put in the code works. </p>
      <br>
      <p>In this website, I used many different types of code. My first step was to make the <br>
      hot air balloon under the draw function. To make it, I used many different shapes. <br>
      I used ellipses to make the balloon part of the hot air balloon. I put multiple <br>
      ellipses, each getting skinnier and alternating colors, inside of one perfect circle <br>
      ellipse to make the stripes. I used lines to make the ropes. The basket and the mini <br>
      baskets on the side of the big basket is made from rectangles. </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p>My second step was to create the moving clouds. To do that, I used a loop, making the <br>
      clouds move. I first made a drawCloud function to draw my cloud so it is organized and <br>
      I can put it directly into the loop. I used a for loop to make the clouds move to the <br>
      right, making the hot air balloon look like it's moving. </p>
      <br>

      <br>
    <p>My next step after the clouds were to make the balloons that appeared when you click on <br>
      the screen. I made a drawBalloon function to make the balloon. I put the drawBalloon <br>
      function in a mouseClicked function to make it appear where ever you click on the screen. <br>
      To make the balloons change color when the location of the mouse changes, I used an if/else <br>
      statement. In it, I made the balloons go from turquiose to flashing different colors. In the <br>
      code, I found a problem where the background kept going over each balloon I made, so to fix <br>
      it, I created an array to store the data so that the background would not go over the balloons. </p>

      <h2> My Take Away </h2>
    <p>What I learned in this project is how to use javascript. I learned how to use many different <br>
      codes in javascript, like how to make a loop, function, array, and how to make shapes. I <br>
      learned that the loop makes things run for a certain amount of time, but not over time. The <br>
      function is to made to perform a particular task. The array is used to store data in your code. <br>
      I had to make many decisions on the different functions I made and how I wanted the loop to work. <br>
      I had to decide on what I wanted to make interactive. Some things I would do to improve my project <br>
      is organize the code a little more, and learn how to use other javascript code to make my art look <br>
      better.
